# Azure Data Factory CI/CD Pipelines with Disaster Recovery

This sample shows how to enable automated blue green deployment for Azure Spring Cloud apps.
The repository contains a sample application and workflows to deploy this application in an automated blue green pattern. The provided sample currently uses the Piggymetrics gateway application, but can be updated for deploying your own Spring Boot application. You can reuse the workflows in the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) folder.
The sample source code is based on the Azure Architecture Center sample for [Azure Spring Cloud blue green deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/example-scenario/blue-green-spring/blue-green-spring).
